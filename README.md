Scalability-TestSuite-Web3
Overview
Scalability-TestSuite-Web3 is a comprehensive testing suite designed to evaluate the scalability, performance, and security of Layer-2 solutions and sidechains in Web3.0. This project focuses on ensuring high transaction throughput, data integrity, and security across blockchain scalability solutions like Optimism, zkSync, and Polygon.

Features
✅ Performance Testing – Simulates high transaction loads on Layer-2 networks.
✅ Data Integrity Checks – Ensures Layer-2 data is securely committed to Layer-1.
✅ Security Audits – Tests vulnerabilities like replay attacks and double-spending.
✅ Automated Testing – Uses Hardhat, ethers.js, Chai/Mocha for test execution.

Testing Scenarios
1. Transaction Throughput Testing
Simulates high transaction loads on Layer-2 networks to test scalability limits.
Measures the average TPS (Transactions Per Second).
2. Data Integrity Verification
Ensures off-chain transactions are properly committed to Layer-1.
Validates Merkle proofs and rollup data consistency.
3. Security Testing
Detects vulnerabilities such as replay attacks, front-running, and double-spending.
Simulates adversarial scenarios to stress-test Layer-2 mechanisms.
Technologies Used
Hardhat – Smart contract testing framework.
Ethers.js – Web3 interaction library.
Mocha & Chai – Unit testing framework.
Solidity – Smart contract language.
