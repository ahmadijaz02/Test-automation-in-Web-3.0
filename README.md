# Scalability-TestSuite-Web3

## Project Description
`Scalability-TestSuite-Web3` is a testing suite designed to assess the scalability, performance, and security of blockchain Layer-2 solutions (e.g., Optimism, zkSync, and Polygon) and sidechains. This project aims to ensure high transaction throughput, data integrity, and robust security for Web3 applications.

## Features
- **Transaction Throughput Testing** – Simulates high-load transaction scenarios.
- **Data Integrity Verification** – Ensures proper off-chain to on-chain data commitments.
- **Security Assessments** – Tests for replay attacks, front-running, and double-spending risks.
- **Automated Smart Contract Testing** – Uses **Hardhat, Mocha, Chai, and Ethers.js** for rigorous testing.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Scalability-TestSuite-Web3.git
   cd Scalability-TestSuite-Web3
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables** (Create a `.env` file)
   ```env
   INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_api_key
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
   ```

## Usage

### Run Tests
```sh
npx hardhat test
```

### Deploy Smart Contracts
```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

### Run Performance Benchmarking
```sh
node scripts/performance-test.js
```

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Transaction Throughput Testing
- Simulates high transaction loads on Layer-2 networks.
- Measures TPS (Transactions Per Second) and gas efficiency.

### 2. Data Integrity Verification
- Ensures that off-chain transactions are properly committed to Layer-1.
- Verifies Merkle proofs and rollup data consistency.

### 3. Security Testing
- Detects vulnerabilities like replay attacks and double-spending.
- Simulates adversarial scenarios to stress-test Layer-2 mechanisms.

## Technologies Used
- **Hardhat** – Smart contract testing framework.
- **Ethers.js** – Web3 interaction library.
- **Mocha & Chai** – Unit testing framework.
- **Solidity** – Smart contract language.
